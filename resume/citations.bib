	abstract = {In this paper we will explore a proposed data generation method which will construct the feature matrix for a multi-layer perceptron model designed to estimate the pricing functional of path-dependent financial derivatives. We will explore the theoretical framework and specifications for barrier and Asian option feature generation along with their respective multi-layer perceptron architectures and model performance metrics. We will demonstrate how the proposed models can retain pricing errors below one percent while reducing the computation time by up to 99.8\%.},
